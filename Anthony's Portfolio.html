<h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
<p>My name is Anthony Xayakham, I graduated from Texas Woman's University with a Bachelor's Degree in Kinesiology.</p>

<article id "Experiences">
<h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
<p>I worked at Texas HEB as an exercise physiologist. I worked in the Cardiac Rehab and was able to learn a lot about EKG's.</p>
<p>After Texas Health HEB, I was hired on at the Legacy Heart Center as an exercise physiologist. It was a bit different from cardiac rehab by different testings we had to do. The testing included exercising patients to their max heart rate and if patients were unable to exercise on the treadmill there was a pharmalogical stress test. Once we have achieved the max heart rate the nuclear tech would inject a tracer via IV and it would make the heart glow under the camera.</p>
<p> From Legacy Heart Center, I was hired on as a police officer in The Colony. I went through 6 months of training and did 5 months of field training. I was able to learn a lot in that short time frame.</p>
